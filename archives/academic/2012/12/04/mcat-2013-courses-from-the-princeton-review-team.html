<p>Hello McGill Graduate Student Association for Neuroscience Members!</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Exams are coming up, which means the first half of the school year is almost done!  2013 will bring a new year and a changing MCAT.  There is no more writing sample on the MCAT, making it shorter now than ever!  There is a new, <em>optional</em> section at the end of the test.  If you elect to write this optional section on test day, the AAMC will give you a $30 Amazon gift card.  The details of these changes to the test and to our prep courses are outlined in the attached document.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>I’d also like to let you know that you have until December 12th to take advantage of the maximum discount off of our courses starting in January!  If you enroll in a course at least one month before the course start date you will receive a $100 early enrollment discount.  You can combine this with your $200 student group discount by entering this promotion code at the checkout:  TORMTLNS$200.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Feel free to contact us at 1-888-876-5545 x.1207 if you have any questions!</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Good luck on exams and Happy Holidays!</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p> </p>
