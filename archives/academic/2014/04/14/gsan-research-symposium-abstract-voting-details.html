<p>Over the next two weeks, you will have a chance to read and select which abstracts you would like to see presented at the GSAN research symposium on Friday May 23rd.</p>

<p>There are two pdf documents (see link below) containing abstracts in the Cellular &amp; Molecular and Systems Neuroscience categories (there are ten abstracts in each section, which are arranged in alphabetical order based on title). Author names and affiliations have been removed to reduce bias in voting.</p>

<p>Abstract voting is open from Monday April 14th to Monday April 28th. Don’t miss your chance to have a voice in what topics/presentations are included in the research symposium!</p>

<p>Once you have read the abstracts, please follow the links below to make your selections among the Cellular &amp; Molecular and/or Systems Neuroscience abstracts. There are ten abstracts in each section and you will be instructed to select the top four. A ranking of 1 will assign 5 points to an abstract, 2 will assign 3 points, 3 will assign 2 points, 4 will assign 1 point, and being unranked will not assign any points. The four presenters selected for each section will be those with the highest number of overall points.</p>
