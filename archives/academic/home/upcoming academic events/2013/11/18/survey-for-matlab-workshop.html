<p>Based on responses from our start-of-the-year survey GSAN is planning to host a MATLAB-related workshop early in the new year. We would appreciate feedback from students, particularly if you are interested in attending such a workshop.Â  Please let us know what subjects you would like to be taught, your experience level with MATLAB, and any other suggestion you might have.</p>
