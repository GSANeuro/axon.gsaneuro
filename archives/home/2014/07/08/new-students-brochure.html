<p>Dear new graduate students of the IPN,</p>

<p>Congratulations on your admission to McGill and welcome to the IPN! <br />
We are the Graduate Student Association of Neuroscience (GSAN), an organization that represents graduate and post-graduate students enrolled in the IPN at McGill. Our goal is to promote a sense of community between students in the IPN and to provide a platform for social and educational interactions between students across all research institutes in Montreal. <br />
We have compiled a few useful links and information that will hopefully help you with your new start in at McGill and in Montreal. Take a look at it and please donâ€™t hesitate to contact us if you have further questions or comments! <br />
We are currently planning welcome &amp; social events for all of you on Friday, September 5th. The events will be linked to a mandatory info session organized by the IPN administrators.</p>
